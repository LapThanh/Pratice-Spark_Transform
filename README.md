# Pratice-Spark_Transform


This repo is to practice and learning transform data using Apache Spark

This project is intended for implementing data transformation using Spark and AWS, so it won't involve much business logic. ( just Transform and Transform )

For Spark, i will use Databricks in AWS cloud, i will choose cd5.large instance to practice, it just cost 0.3 USD/Hours



in th√≠s pratice project, i will use s3 storage to store raw data and transform data instead of storing in my local computer
